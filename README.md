# Chorer

I had the idea for this project a long time ago, I just never got around to actually doing it.

---

## The base concept

Chorer is an application where you and your friends can compete with each other over everyday tasks, by measuring who has been the most productive.

It is a normal TO-DO or calendar app in it's base, but with a couple extra features

I plan on awarding points to user based on the lenght of the activities they complete.
